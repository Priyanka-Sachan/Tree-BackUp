1. Introduction - Definition of the term asked in the question followed by a constitutional article/statistical figure/basic background of the term whichever is relevant.
2. Body - this would usually involve a 360 degree analysis of the question as far as possible. I would discuss the political, legal, social, economic, historical etc perspectives here. If positives or negatives are required, I would also write those down. I usually followed the point format for this section. Cite statistical or current affairsâ€™ examples wherever possible.
3. Conclusion and way forward - provide a balanced conclusion after assessing the positives and negatives. Recommend a way forward and cite any govt reports for the same, if possible. I sometimes used points and at other times used paragraphs.
